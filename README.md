**TBD**  
A pomodoro is a time management method to help people stay focused. The point of this repo is to learn JavaScript by building a pomodoro app

Goal: Create a basic pomodoro app using a minute number field and a second number field. Validate that the numbers are valid for minutes (< 60 minutes) and seconds (< 60 seconds). Get value from the field and start the counter. Be able to add as mean timers as you need be able to pause timers.

You will use:

- setInterval
- Object methods like Object.values
- Array methods like Array.from
